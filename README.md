## About the Project

**GPIO Control** is a component developed for the ESP-IDF framework that simplifies GPIO control on ESP32 devices. This project provides an intuitive interface to easily configure and control GPIO pins, saving time and effort in embedded projects.

### Main Features:
- Simplified GPIO pin configuration
- Clear abstraction interface for easy usage

## Tools and Technologies Used

During the development of **GPIO Control**, the following tools and technologies were used:

### Hardware
- **ESP Model**: ESP32 DevKit V1
- **Architecture**: Dual-Core Xtensa LX6
- **Flash Memory**: 4 MB (standard for most DevKit V1 models)
- **Available GPIO Pins**: 34 GPIO pins (with multiple functions including PWM, ADC, and DAC)
- **Supported Interfaces**: UART, SPI, I2C, CAN, Ethernet, and others
- **Operating Voltage**: 3.3V
- **Micro-USB Connector**: For power and code upload

### Frameworks and SDK
- **PlatformIO**: Version 6.8.1 (espressif32)
- **ESP-IDF**: Version 5.3.1

### Development Environment
- **Visual Studio Code**:
  - Recommended Extensions:
    - [PlatformIO IDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide): Main tool used in the project for managing and compiling ESP32 projects.
    - [Espressif IDF Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=espressif.esp-idf-extension): Alternative to PlatformIO, offering full official integration with ESP-IDF, ideal for those who prefer working directly with Espressif's SDK.
    - [C/C++ Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack): For advanced C++ support.

## Getting Started

### Requisites
Before starting, make sure you have the following:
- **ESP-IDF** installed (minimum version: 4.x)
- An **ESP32** microcontroller

### Installation and setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Dhuky/GPIO-Control.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and compile it using the command `pio run`, or if your development environment is properly configured, `idf.py build`. Using PlatformIO and VSCode, it's graphically easy to do the same without terminal commands, just click the checkmark icon `ðŸ—¸` on the IDE's bottom bar.
3. Wait for success to be generated at the terminal and the project is ready to be loaded on your microcontroller
4. Use the `pio run --target upload` command automatically to ESP32. Make sure the plate is connected via USB and that the correct serial port is configured, Or with at Esp-Didf Terminal `idf-py flash`. With Platformio and VSCode it is easy to click on the icon `->` with the proper serial port of the connected device '![Schematic Diagram](images/serialport.png)' ttyusb0 in my case that I use the Linux system, if the system is windows will be described with `COM` port

## Circuit Assembly

### Schematic Diagram
Here is a basic schematic diagram for assembly using the **ESP32 DevKit V1**:

</div>


### Required Components:
- 1 x **ESP32** board
- 1 x LED of your preferred color (In this example, an external LED is used, but ESP32 boards like the DevKit V1 have an onboard LED that can be used)
- 1 x 1kâ„¦ resistor (lower values like 330Î© are also sufficient)
- Jumper wires

### Step-by-step assembly:
1. Connect the **anode (positive pin)** of the LED to pin **D2** of the ESP32 through the 1kâ„¦ resistor.
2. Connect the **cathode (negative pin)** of the LED to **GND** on the ESP32.
3. Make sure all connections are secure before powering the circuit.
